Use two attached excel files together. Default arms and armour are garbage that doesn't make sense, and class proficiencies are remade with rewritten equipment in mind.
I also urge you to consider using optional hitpoints rule as that will get rid of hp bloat problem while still maintaining reasonable amounts of hp for every creature or npc player may encounter.

Have a good one.
